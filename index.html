    <p>Niftybot was an attempt to create a custom Discord bot for, at the time, a Guild Wars guild Discord.  However, after awhile, interest
    was lost and the bot stopped being worked on.  It's honestly got some hacky code within that was never rewritten, and the 3.0 rewrite
    to bring it uptodate with the current discord.py release was never finished.  At this point, if you run the version specified in the
    requirements.txt file, the bot will work fine for the most part.  Someday this might get completely redone, but with the multitude
    of highly functional bots that exist, that chance is limited.  SnoringNinja isn't going anywhere, it's just not actively working
    on anything at this time. We'll be back at some point with a new project.</p>
